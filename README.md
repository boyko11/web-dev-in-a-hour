Welcome to Web Dev!
===================
You are one hour away from becoming a pro!
Let's build a web app.
  
Prerequisites
-----
1. Web Server
    * Serves the page(s) we create. Though, we could also see how files look without a server. 
    * In this tutorial we will be using apache(httpd): http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/install.html
    * We will save the web pages under /var/www/html - this is apache's default location for *nix OS's
    * Test apache is running : open a browser and go to http://localhost
    * Create a test file (any extension or no extension) under /var/www/html and make sure you can access it http://localhost/test

2. Editor
    * whatever you want (atom, sublime, notepad++, vim, bunch of others)
    * I will be using IntelliJ IDEA


What functionality are we building?
-----
User Stories (https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/user-stories/)
	
	As a User I should be able to see a list of psychologist
	As a User I should be able to select a psychologist
	As a User I should be able to have a conversation with the psychologist I have chosen.

Let's start building
-----

1. Create a folder "psychologist" under /var/www/html, to hold our "psychologist" app
2. Create a index.html file with some initial html
    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
        <head>
            <title>Psychologist</title>
        </head>
        <body>
            <h1>Hello, You need help and I can help you</h1>
        </body>
    </html>
    ```
        
3. Make sure you can access the file
    * Browse to localhost/psychologist
    * If apache finds an index.html file in a directory - it serves it
    
4. Let's build User Story 1
    As a User I should be able to see a list of psychologist
    
    * Under the `<h1>` in index.html, add a section to hold the list of available psychologists:
    ```html
    <section>
      <h2>Select your pshychologist</h2>
      <div id="psychologist-list">
      </div>
    </section>
    ```
    * Test to make sure the new section renders:
        http://localhost/psychologist

    * Get the List of psychlogists from the server:
        * Simulate a backend call:
        * Simulated Data (JSON List of Psychologists):
        ```json
        [
          {
            "id": 1,
            "name": "Sigmund Freud",
            "years_of_experience": 160,
            "rate": "160 Euro/hr" 
          },
          {
            "id": 2,
            "name": "Dr. Phil",
            "years_of_experience": 20,
            "rate": "$3.25/hr" 
          },
          {
            "id": 3,
            "name": "Cookie Monster",
            "years_of_experience": 50,
            "rate": "7 cookies/hour"
          },
          {
            "id": 4,
            "name": "Borat",
            "years_of_experience": 10,
            "rate": "1 goat/hour"
          }
        ]
        ```
        * Save the data in list.json file in the psychologist folder
        * Test the simulated server call: http://localhost/psychologist/list.json
        * Cool, now we have a back-end API which gives us the data for the list of all psychologist
    
    * Q: How do we get the data to display? - A: Javascript(jQuery) and Ajax.
        * What's jQuery? - it is a developer friendly abstraction of javascript. It is a javascript library. You can accomplish everything with pure javascript,
        but jQuery makes it easier for the dev and it also abstracts some of the cross-browser dev effort
        * Let's download the latest version: http://jquery.com/download/ and place it in the "pshychologist" folder
        * At the time of this download, the prod jQuery release is jquery-3.1.1.min.js
        * Let's include(import) jQuery, so we can use it
            * Right before ```</head>```
            ```javascript
            <script src="jquery-3.1.1.min.js"></script>
            ```
        * Make a back-end call to '/psychologist/list.json' (from the front-end mark-up - index.html)
            * Include the following javascript right before ```</body>``` in index.html
            ```javascript
            <script>
              $(document).ready(function() {
                  
                  console.log("Hey there, I will be calling the server to get a list of psychos here.")
              });
            </script>
            ```
            * Save the file
            * Browse to http://localhost/psychologist
            * Inside the browser, hit F12, make sure you see the console.log line displayed
            * Cool, we saw stuff print in the console. Now, Let's make an actual server call.
            * Change the script to make an AJAX call to the server, to get the list of all psychologists:
            ```javascript
            <script>
                $(document).ready(function() {
    
                    console.log("Hey there, I will be calling the server to get a list of psychos here.");
                    $.ajax({
                        url: "/psychologist/list.json"
                    }).done( function( list_of_psychologists_from_server ) {
                    
                        console.log(list_of_psychologists_from_server);
                    }).fail( function() {
                    
                        alert('You messed up!');
                    });
                });
            </script>
            ```
            * Save the file, refresh http://localhost/psychologist, make sure the list of psychologists shows up in the console, expand through the object to see the actual data
            * Let's make a call to a non-existing back-end call, so we also test the ```.fail``` callback: 
            * Change '/psychologist/list.json' to '/psychologist/BLAH.json', refresh the page, make sure you see the alert, then revert the change.
            
        * Now, let's display the list of psychologists on the page
            Change this line:
            ```javascript
            console.log(list_of_psychologists_from_server);
            ```
            To this:
            ```
            $('div#psychologist-list').html( JSON.stringify( list_of_psychologists_from_server ) );
            ```
            
            The previous line finds the ```<div>``` with an "id" of "psychologist-list" and sets its content to the response we got from the server(the list of psychologists)
        
            * Let's see if it works - F5. All right! Nice, but not very usable.
            * Let's mock up something a bit prettier
            ```html
            <div id="psychologist-mock-up">
                <ul>
                  <li>Name: Sigmund Freud</li>
                  <li>Experience: 7 years</li>
                  <li>Rate: $150</li>
                </ul>
            
                <ul>
                  <li>Name: Dr. Phil</li>
                  <li>Experience: 77 years</li>
                  <li>Rate: $57</li>
                </ul>
            
                <ul>
                  <li>Name: Cookie Monster</li>
                  <li>Experience: 887 years</li>
                  <li>Rate: $987</li>
                </ul>
            
                <ul>
                  <li>Name: Borat</li>
                  <li>Experience: 951 years</li>
                  <li>Rate: $777</li>
                </ul>
        
            </div>
            ```
            * Place the html snippet right above the ```<div id="psychologist-list">```
            * F5 at the browser to test it - Better, but not great. We care about functionality for now. We will make it even prettier later.
            * Now, let's replace the static data with the dynamic data we got from the server:
                Notice how the ```<ul>``` part repeats?
                The data changes, but the structure stays the same. Perfect for a template, right?
                
                * Create a single psychologist template
                * For every psychologist - populate the template with the specific data
                * Concat all the populated templates
                * Set the content of ```<div id="psychologist-list"></div>``` to the String resulting from the concat of the individual populated templates
            
            * Create a single psychologist template and place it right before the ```<script>```
            ```html
            <template id="psychologist-template">
                <div>
                    <ul>
    
                        <li>
                            <label>Name:</label>
                            <span class="psycho-name"></span>
                        </li>
    
                        <li>
                            <label>Experience:</label>
                            <span class="psycho-experience"></span>
                        </li>
    
                        <li>
                            <label>Rate:</label>
                            <span class="psycho-rate"></span>
                        </li>
    
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </template>
            ```
            * For every psychologist - populate the template with the specific data:
            * Replace ```$('div#psychologist-list').html( JSON.stringify( list_of_psychologists_from_server ) );``` with the following snippet
            ```javascript
                var psychologist_div_content = '';

                list_of_psychologists_from_server.forEach( function( psychologist ) {

                    var psychologist_template = $($('template#psychologist-template').html());
                    psychologist_template.find('span.psycho-name').html( psychologist.name );
                    psychologist_template.find('span.psycho-experience').html( psychologist.years_of_experience );
                    psychologist_template.find('span.psycho-rate').html( psychologist.rate );
                    psychologist_div_content += psychologist_template.html();
                });

                $('div#psychologist-list').html( psychologist_div_content );
            ```
                * Line by line explanation:
                                   
                    ```var psychologist_template = $($('template#psychologist-template').html());```<br/>
                    Locates and retrieves the single psychologist template and creates(cookie cuts) a jQuery object off of it
                    
                    ```psychologist_template.find('span.psycho-name').html( psychologist.name );```<br/>
                    Locates and retrieves ```<span class="psycho-name"></span>``` ; Sets the content of it to the name from the psychologist json ```{ "name": "Sigmund Freud"}```
                    
                    ```psychologist_div_content += psychologist_template.html();```<br/>
                    Concats the specific psychologist's populated template to the accumulated mark-up
                    
                    ```$('div#psychologist-list').html( psychologist_div_content );```<br/>
                    Locates and retrieves the ```<div>``` with "id" of "psychologist-list".;
                    Sets the content of the ```<div>``` to the accumulated psychologists mark-up
                    
            * Remove the mocked up div ```<div id="psychologist-mock-up">```
            * Save the file and F5 at the browser to test
            * Cool, so this is what we did
                * We created a template for a psychologist
                * We got a list of psychologist from the server with Ajax(jQuery)
                * We used javascript(jQuery) to populate the template and accumulate the templates into one string
                * We used javascript(jQuery) to set the content of a ```<div>``` to the accumulated string
                ```javascript
                <template id="psychologist-template">
                    <div
                        <div>
                            <ul>
            
                                <li>
                                    <label>Name:</label>
                                    <span class="psycho-name"></span>
                                </li>
            
                                <li>

                                    <span class="psycho-experience"></span>
                                </li>
            
                                <li>
                                    <label>Rate:</label>
                                    <span class="psycho-rate"></span>
                                </li>
            
                            </ul>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </template>
                <script>
                    $(document).ready(function() {
        
                        console.log("Hey there, I will be calling the server to get a list of psychos here.");
                        $.ajax({
                            url: "/psychologist/list.json"
                        }).done( function( list_of_psychologists_from_server ) {
        
                            var psychologist_div_content = '';
        
                            list_of_psychologists_from_server.forEach( function( psychologist ) {
        
                                var psychologist_template = $($('template#psychologist-template').html());
                                psychologist_template.find('span.psycho-name').html( psychologist.name );
                                psychologist_template.find('span.psycho-experience').html( psychologist.years_of_experience );
                                psychologist_template.find('span.psycho-rate').html( psychologist.rate );
                                psychologist_div_content += psychologist_template.html();
                            });
        
                            $('div#psychologist-list').html( psychologist_div_content );
        
                        }).fail( function() {
        
                            alert('You messed up!');
                        });
                    });
                </script>
                ```
4. Let's build User Story 2
                
    As a User I should be able to select a psychologist
    
    * Since we can have a session with one psychologist, let's make the selection of a psychologist a radio button
        * Change the template to
        ```html
        <template id="psychologist-template">
            <div>
                <div>
                    <input type="radio" class="psycho-name" name="psycho-name" value=""/>
                    <span class="psycho-name"></span>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <label>Experience:</label>
                            <span class="psycho-experience"></span>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <label>Rate:</label>
                            <span class="psycho-rate"></span>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </div>
        </template>
        ```
        * Javascript change to save the psychologist id, which we will later send to the server, when the psychologist is selected.
        Add
        ```javascript
        psychologist_template.find('input.psycho-name').val(psychologist.id);
        ```
        Right after:
        ```javascript
        var psychologist_template = $($('template#psychologist-template').html());
        ```
        * Let's make sure the changed worked - F5, F12, let's find the id in the dom
    * Now, let's turn the list of psychologists into a form and send our preference to the server
      * wrap the ```<div id="pshychologists-list">``` within a ```<form>```
      ```html
      <form>
          <div id="psychologist-list">
          </div>
      </form>
      ```
      * POST the selection to the server
          * bind a radio-button change event - add anywhere in the $(document).ready block
          ```javascript
            $('html').on('change', 'input[type=radio][name=psycho-name]', function() {
               console.log('change event!');
            });
          ```
          * Test the change - make sure you see the console statement
          * Let's POST the selection to the server
          ```javascript
          //bind radio-button
          $('html').on('change', 'input[type=radio][name=psycho-name]', function() {
              console.log('change event!');
              var post_data = {};
              post_data.id = $(this).val();
              $.ajax({
                  url: "/psychologist/preference-save.json",
                  type: "post",
                  data: post_data
              }).done( function( saved_preference ) {
                  console.log("Successful Post!");
              }).fail( function() {

                alert('You messed up!');
              });
          });
          ```
          * Let's test the post, F5 and select one of the radios - should get an error, since we don't have the emulated back end, so let's do that
          * Create a file "preference-save.json"
          ```javascript
          {
              "id": 1,
              "name": "Psychologist",
              "value": "Sigmund Freud",
              "status": "active"
          }
          ```
          * Let's make sure we don't get an error this time - F5 and select a radio again
          * Now, let's do something with the successfully returned saved preference
          * We will just display a successful message with the data returned from the server
          * Let's create a template and place right after(or right before) the existing template
          ```html
          <template id="saved-preference">
              <div>
                  <div>
                      <div>Congrats!</div>
                      <div>You have successfully saved your preference for a </div>
                      <div class="preference-name"></div>
                      <div> as </div>
                      <div class="preference-value"></div>
                  </div>
              </div>
          </template>
          ```
          * Now let's crank out the javascript to populate the template and display it
          * In the "done" callback for the POST, let's put this javascript
          ```javascript
          var preference_template = $($('template#saved-preference').html());
          preference_template.find('div.preference-name').html( saved_preference.name );
          preference_template.find('div.preference-value').html( saved_preference.value );
          console.log(preference_template.html());
          ```
          * Save it and test it(F5 and make sure the constructed mark-up displays in the console)
          * No let's make the mark-up display
          * Add an invisible container div, which we will populate with the dynamically generated mark-up and make visible
          * Add this html right after ```</form>```
          ```html
          <div id="saved-preference-container" style="display: none">
          </div>
          ```
          * Inject the dynamic mark-up into it
          ```javascript
          //console.log(preference_template.html());
          $('#saved-preference-container').html(preference_template.html());
          ```
          * Let's look at the DOM to see if it worked
          * Now Let's make the list of psychologists disappear and make the saved preference appear
          ```javascript
          $('#saved-preference-container').html(preference_template.html());
          $('#psychologist-list').hide();
          $('#saved-preference-container').show();
          ```
          * Not bad, but let's make it fancier - fade out the list and fade in the preference
          ```
          $('#psychologist-list').fadeOut(1500, function() {
            $('#saved-preference-container').fadeIn(1500);
          });
          ```
          * OK, we have something functional, but let's make it a little easier on the eyes
          * Let's crank out some css
          * The header seems big, let's make it smaller h1 to h2 (not css yet)
          * Now, let's move it a little to the right
          ```html
          <h2 style="margin-left: 20%;">
          ```
          * How about some borders around it
          ```html
          <h2 style="margin-left: 20%;border: 1px solid black">
          ```
          * Let's make it less wide
          ```html
          <h2 style="margin-left: 20%;border: 1px solid black;width: 40%">
          ```
          * Let's center align the text
          ```html
          <h2 style="margin-left: 20%;border: 1px solid black;width: 40%;text-align: center;">
          ```
          * Let's pad it up and down
          ```html
          <h2 style="margin-left: 20%;border: 1px solid black;width: 40%;text-align: center;padding-top: 1em;padding-bottom: 1em;">
          ```
          * Let's smooth out the borders
          ```html
          <h2 style="margin-left: 20%;border: 1px solid black;width: 40%;text-align: center;padding-top: 1em;padding-bottom: 1em;border-radius: .5em">
          ```
          * Let's make the background gray
          ```html
          <h2 style="margin-left: 20%;border: 1px solid black;width: 40%;text-align: center;padding-top: 1em;padding-bottom: 1em;border-radius: .5em;background-color: #c8cbd1">
          ```
          * Cool, but pretty long of a line, let's put all these styles in a class and just attach the class to the element
            * Add right before ```</head>```
            ```css
            <style>
                .gray-box {
                    margin-left: 20%;
                    border: 1px solid black;
                    width: 40%;
                    text-align: center;
                    padding-top: 1em;
                    padding-bottom: 1em;
                    border-radius: .5em;
                    background-color: #c8cbd1;
                }
            </style>
            ```
            * Change the h2 to ```<h2 class='gray-box'```
          
          * Could we make the rest of the content be a gray-box? 
          * Yah, let's change ```<section>``` to ```<section class='gray-box'>```
          * Let's see what it looks like
          * How about slightly different, lighter gray box, yet still keeping the rest of the styles of gray box
          ```css
          .light-gray-box {
              background-color: #efefef !important;
              margin-top: 1em;
              border-radius: 2em;
          }
          ```
          * Change ```<section class='gray-box'>``` to ```<section class='gray-box light-gray-box'>```
          * A bit misaligned - let's fix it
          * Let's give the div that contains the psychologist a class and then attach a style to it
          ```html
          <div class="psychologist-container">
              <input type="radio" class="psycho-name" name="psycho-name" value=""/>
          ```
          ```css
          .psychologist-container {
              text-align: left;
              margin-left: 10%;
          }
          ```
          * CSS can get pretty long, so let's put it in another file - create app.css in the "psychologist" folder and save the CSS there
          * replace the ```<style``` block in index.html with
          ```html
          <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="app.css" />
          ```
          * Javascript can get pretty long too, so let's outsource that too - create app.js in the "psychologist" folder and copy the contents of the ```<script>``` block there
          * add the following line right AFTER the jQuery script include
          ```javascript
          <script src="app.js"></script>
          ```
          * Cool - cleaner, more modular code. That's all for now.
